MatGPT is a MATLAB app that allows you to easily access OpenAI's ChatGPT API. With the app, you can load a list of prompts for specific use cases and engage in conversations with ease. If you're new to ChatGPT and prompt engineering, MatGPT is a great way to learn. 

The app simply serves as an interface to the ChatGPT API. You should be familiar with the limitations and risks associated with using this technology as well as with [OpenAI terms and policies](https://openai.com/policies). You are responsible for any fees OpenAI may charge for the use of their API. 

MatGPT was updated to run on the framework from the '[Large Language Models (LLMs) with MATLAB](https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/llms-with-matlab/)' repo maintained by MathWorks.

[MATLAB AI Chat Playground](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/playground/) is a great alternative to MatGPT on MATLAB Central. 

## What's New

* MatGPT runs on the 'LLMs with MATLAB' framework, which requires MATLAB R2023a or later. 
* MatGPT detects a URL included in a prompt, and retrieve its web content into the chat.
* MatGPT lets you import a .m, .mlx, or .csv file into the chat. 

Please note that imported content will be truncated if it exceeds the context window limit. 

## Requirements

* **MathWorks Products (https://www.mathworks.com)**:  To use MatGPT, you need to have MATLAB R2023a or later installed on your computer. 
* **OpenAI API Key**: Additionally, you will need your own API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). [MATLAB AI Chat Playground](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/playground/) is a better option if you donâ€™t want to set up an API access with OpenAI. 
* GPT-4 models are [available to all API users who have a history of successful payments](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability). If you have not made any payment to OpenAI, the model is not accessible. 

## Installation

### MATLAB Online

To use MatGPT on MATLAB Online, simply click [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=toshiakit/MatGPT&file=MatGPT.mlapp)

#### MATLAB Desktop

1. Download the content of this repository into a MATLAB path. 
2. Launch MATLAB 
3. type 'MatGPT' in the command window

## How to use: MatGPT app

![MatGPT Chat Tab](images/MatGPT.gif)

1. Click on `+ New Chat` in the left nav to add a new chat. This opens the `Settings` tab. 
2. In the `Settings` tab, either choose a preset to populate the settings or customize on your own. Once you have completed the settings, click `Start New Chat` to initiate a chat. This will take you back to the `Main` tab. 
* Presets are loaded from [Presets.csv](contents/presets.csv) - feel free to customize your prompts. 
3. In the `Main` tab, a sample prompt is already provided based on the preset you selected, but feel free to replace it with your own. When you click `Send` button, the response will be shown in the 'Chat' tab. 
* The paperclip button lets you include the content of a m-file, live script file or csv file in the chat.
* If the prompt contains a URL, MatGPT ask you to confirm that you want to open the page. 
* The `Send` button and Paperclip button are disabled until a chat is configured in the `Settings` tab.
* If you want suggestion for follow-up questions in the response, check `Suggest follow-up questions` checkbox. 
* If your prompt is intended to generate MATLAB code, check `Test Generated MATLAB Code` checkbox to test the returned code.
* The `Usage` tab shows the number of tokens used in the current chat session. 
* Add stop sequences in `Advanced` tab to specify the sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens
4. Continue the conversation by keep adding more prompts and clicking `Send`. 
5. You can right-click or double-click a chat in the left navigation panel to rename, delete, or save the chat to a text file. 
6. When you close the app, the chat will be saved and will be reloaded into the left nav when you relaunch the app.

### Note:

You can increase the connection timeout in the `Settings`. You can add proxy via [Web Preferences](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/preferences.html) in MATLAB.

## What happened to chatGPT class?

chatGPT class was replaced by the framework provided via the '[Large Language Models (LLMs) with MATLAB](https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/llms-with-matlab/)' repo. The new framework supports function calling and other latest features. Please refer to the documentation in the repo to learn how to use it.
